#BandTix#

The purpose of the Band Tix web application is to provide an easy and concise way for bands to track the sales, distribution and costings for tickets.

###What makes BandTix different?###

There are quite a few ticket management web applications in the market, but to us none of them seemed clean and simple to use. They were all either very cumbersome to use or tried to do too much, thus distracting from the main purpose of the application.

The initial idea is for us not to sell the tickets through the website, but rather provide a basic platform where band can enter an event, with details like venue, time, etcâ€¦ as well as enter how many tickets they have to sell. Then provide a very easy way for band members to login and input ticket sales on the fly. Details like who they sold them to, how many guests a particular person could have (resulting in more ticket sales).

The site will also offer a summary/dashboard feature that will show detailed information of tickets sold, analysis of costs, margins and profits (e.g. amounts to be paid to promoters, venues, equipment hire, band members etc).
